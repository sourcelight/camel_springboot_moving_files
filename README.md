# POC Apache Camel

## Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) using Apache Camel

In the application is reported a sample case of using Apache camel in the 2 following cases:

- via DSL Java (you can debug in case of issues)
- via XML DSL

The application moves files from one directory to another whenever a new file is inserted

The camel library has already a component to move files, you can find also others specific to access JMS, rabbitMQ, etc
